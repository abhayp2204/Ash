# Ash - Abhay's Shell

## Introduction
This is my implementation of a shell. Initially created to develop a deeper understanding of the Linux OS. However, I intend to make this as good as, if not better than Bash. This shell was written entirely in C.

## Functions
Some functions were implemented from scratch, while the rest made use of the exec() family of functions.
### Built In Functions
- cd
- ls
- pinfo
- repeat
